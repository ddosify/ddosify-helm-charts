# Ddosify Helm Charts

This [repository](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify-helm-charts) hosts the Helm charts for the Ddosify.

There are two charts available in this repository:

- üè† [Ddosify Platform Self-Hosted Chart](./charts/ddosify/README.md): Deploy the Ddosify Observability Platform to your Kubernetes cluster. 
- üêù [Alaz Chart - Ddosify eBPF Agent](./charts/alaz/README.md): Deploy the Ddosify eBPF agent (Alaz) to your Kubernetes cluster that you want to monitor. Alaz sends the collected data to the Ddosify platform.

## What is Ddosify?

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/ddosify_service_map.png" alt="Ddosify Kubernetes Monitoring Service Map" />
<i>Ddosify automatically generates Service Map of your K8s cluster without code instrumentation or sidecars with eBPF. So you can easily find the bottlenecks in your system. Red lines indicate the high latency between services.</i>
</p>

Ddosify is an [open-source](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify) Kubernetes Monitoring and Performance Testing platform.

## Pre-requisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) must be installed to use the Ddosify charts.
