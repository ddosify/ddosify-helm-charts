There are two charts available in this repository:

- üêù [Alaz Chart - Ddosify eBPF Agent](#alaz-chart---ddosify-ebpf-agent)

## What is Ddosify?

<p align="center">
<img src="assets/ddosify_service_map.png" alt="Ddosify Kubernetes Monitoring Service Map" />
<i>Ddosify automatically generates Service Map of your K8s cluster without code instrumentation or sidecars with eBPF. So you can easily find the bottlenecks in your system. Red lines indicate the high latency between services.</i>
</p>

Ddosify is an [open-source](https://github.com/ddosify/ddosify) Kubernetes Monitoring and Performance Testing platform.

## Pre-requisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) must be installed to use the Ddosify charts.
